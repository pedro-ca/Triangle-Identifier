# Triangle-Identifier
A program that can identify if a trinagle is isosceles, equilateral or scalene.

#Introduction

A triangle is a geometric figure formed by three lines that meet pairwise and do not pass through the same point, forming three sides and three angles.

By observing the triangle, we can identify some of its elements:

- A, B, and C are the vertices.
- The sides of the triangles are symbolized by the meeting of the vertices (points of intersection).

A triangle can be classified according to the measure of its sides:

- Scalene Triangle: All sides and angles are different.
- Isosceles Triangle: Two sides are equal, and the angles opposite these sides are also equal.
- Equilateral Triangle: All sides and angles are equal. Each angle is 60Â°.

Existence Condition of a Triangle:

- To construct a triangle, we cannot use just any measurements. They must follow the existence condition:
- To construct a triangle, the measure of any one side must be less than the sum of the other two sides.

# Objective

a) Given three values X, Y, Z, write a message informing whether it is an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle.

- Equilateral: All sides are equal.
- Isosceles: Two sides are equal.
- Scalene: All sides are different.

b) If any side length of the triangle is invalid, write the message "Invalid Triangle".
